## Hello world! 👋

<> My name is Carlos. I'm a frontend web developer, with
2 years experience with React and NextJS. </>

I ❤️ coding, and I'm working on my
second personal project. My 9 years experience as a graphic
designer has helped me to improve my work with UI design.

### Portfolio

I'm making my own [portfolio](https://carlosparra.vercel.app) 💼 to
show what I'm working on, and habilities. I'm still working on it,
so it's coming soon.
