## Hello world! 👋

<> My name is Carlos. I'm a frontend web developer, with
1 year experience with React and NextJS. </>

I ❤️ develop software as a service, and i'm working on my
second one, and my experience of almost 10 years as a graphic
designer has helped me to improve my work with UI design.
Despite it, sometimes add Material UI to my projects and some
components to improve my workflow.

### Portfolio

I'm making my own [portfolio](https://carlosparra.vercel.app) 💼 to
show what I'm working on, and habilities. I'm still working on it,
so it's coming soon.
